      <h2>Color Game Instructions</h2>
      <p> <strong>Hello. If you are new to the RGB Color Game or to the RGB
         color system, please read the Insructions
         thoroughly so that the game is as enjoyable as posible.
        </strong> </p>
        <p>
          RGB is a color system used by computers, it can be used to
          define up to 10,000 colors. RGB stands for (red, green, blue) combinations
          of those colors make every color we can see. The first number is how much red
          is in the color, the second number is how much green and
           the third is how much blue, the numbers go from   0 - 255, for example
            <ul>
              <li id="blue">light blue =  rgb(0, 160, 240)</li>
              <li id="pink">pink =  rgb(255, 0, 255)</li>
              <li id="yellow">yellow =  rgb(255, 230, 0)</li>
              <li id="black">black =  rgb(0, 0, 0)</li>
              <li id="white">white =  rgb(255, 255, 255)</li>
            </ul>

             <!-- <span <li></li>>rgb(0, 160, 240)</span> is light blue, this:
            <span id="pink">rgb(255, 0, 255)</span> is pink and this:
             <span id="yellow">rgb(255, 230, 0)</span> is yellow, black is:
              <span id="black">rgb(0, 0, 0)</span> and white is: <span id="white">rgb(255, 255, 255)</span>.
        --></p>
        <p>
          To play the game you have to guess what color
	     the RGB at the top of the page is and pick a
          color out of the six options if your guess is wrong
          that option will disappear and you can guess again.
           If you want different colors click New Colors
            and you can change to three options by clicking Easy.
